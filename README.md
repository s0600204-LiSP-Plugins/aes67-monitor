The **AES67 Monitor** is a community-created plugin for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

This plugin adds the ability to monitor the AES67 Daemon, and through it AES67 and AES67-compatible
audio streams on the network.


### Installation


To use, navigate to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/LinuxShowPlayer/$LiSP_Version/plugins/` (on
most Linux systems `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is `~/.local/share`), and create a subfolder
named `aes67_plotter`.

Place the files comprising this plugin into this new folder.

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load the plugin
automatically.
